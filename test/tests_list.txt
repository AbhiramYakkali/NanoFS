This file is a list of all the current test cases and what they are intended to test


FUNCTIONALITY TESTS

test0:
- Create file, write to and read from that file

test1:
- Create multiple files, write to and read from files

test2:
- Create a directory, create files inside and outside, write to and read from files
- Make sure files can only be read from within their cwd

test7:
- Delete a file and ensure that it no longer exists
- Try recreating a file with the same name and make sure it doesn't retain old contents

test9:
- Test path resolution for reading and writing files using paths (dir/dir/file)
- Create nested directories and files using path notation

test10:
- Test duplicate file and directory creation
- Verify that files and directories can have the same name (different types)

test11:
- Test overwriting file contents multiple times
- Write different length content including empty strings

test12:
- Test deeply nested directories (3+ levels)
- Create files at different nesting levels and access them via paths

test13:
- Test removing files from subdirectories
- Verify inode and data block reuse after deletion

test14:
- Test creating many files in one directory (exceeding DENTRIES_PER_BLOCK = 4)
- Verify multiple data blocks are allocated for directory entries

test15:
- Test save and open commands with multi-line files
- Save small multi-line file, read it back, and verify with open command
- Test large multi-block files (>2KB spanning 3 blocks)
- Verify FILE_VERIFY functionality in test runner

test16:
- Test resource exhaustion - running out of data blocks
- Creates 800+ files to exhaust available data blocks (~1008 total)
- Verifies error handling when no free data blocks exist
- Ensures existing files remain accessible after exhaustion

test17:
- Test resource exhaustion - running out of inodes
- Creates 255 files to exhaust all available inodes (256 total, 0 is root)
- Verifies "All inodes are being used" error message
- Tests inode reuse after file deletion

test18:
- Test rm command with path resolution
- Remove files using paths: dir/file, dir/dir/file, dir/dir/dir/file
- Verify files are removed correctly by checking with ls and read
- Test error handling for invalid paths (nonexistent directories and files)
- Test resource reuse (inodes and data blocks) after deletion
- Test complex cd paths like ../.. and ../../..


ERROR CHECK TESTS

test3:
- Trying to read/write from a file that doesn't exist

test4:
- Trying to enter a directory that doesn't exist

test5:
- Trying to read/write from a file that doesn't exist when there's a directory of the same name

test6:
- Trying to enter a directory that doesn't exist when there's a file of the same name

test8:
- Checking if files with the same starting string can coexist
